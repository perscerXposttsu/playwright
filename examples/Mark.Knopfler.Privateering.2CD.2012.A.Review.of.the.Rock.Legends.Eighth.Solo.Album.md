## What is Privateering?
 
Privateering is a term that refers to the practice of engaging in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, also known as a letter of marque, authorized the holder to capture enemy vessels and bring them before admiralty courts for condemnation and sale. Privateering was a common activity in the 16th to 19th centuries, especially during times of war between European powers.
 
Mark Knopfler chose this title for his album because he felt it reflected his artistic freedom and independence. He said in an interview: "I just do what I want to do. I don't have to answer to anybody. I'm not part of any system. I'm a privateer."
